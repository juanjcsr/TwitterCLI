# TwitterCLI

**Twitter CLI** is a lightweight Twitter CLI I made in order to learn more about Go. 
I will update it along my new findings in the Go Language.

This is an educational application, that is why I tried to implement all Twitter calls
from scratch.

## Running it

First, clone the repo
```
go get github.com/juanjcsr/twittercli
```

To run it for the first time, you will need your **Twitter Consumer Key** and your **Twitter Consumer Secret**

```go run twitter.go```

inside the cloned repository directory.
