# TwitterCLI

**Twitter CLI** is a lightweight Twitter CLI I made in order to learn more about Go. 
I will update it along my new findings in the Go Language.

This is an educational application, that is why I tried to implement all Twitter calls
from scratch.

## Running it

First, clone the repo
```
go get github.com/juanjcsr/twittercli
```

For the first time run, you will need two environment variables: *TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY* and *TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET*

`TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=<your consumer key> TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET<your secret key> go run twittercli.go`
